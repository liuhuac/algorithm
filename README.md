# algorithm
a collection of solutions for algorithm questions from exercises.

# To use the makefile to compile your java programs:
1. implement your algorithm in .java files;
2. modify the CLASSES macro so that it has the names of your .java files;
3. run 'make', and if all goes well, it should compile all your java source files that need to be re-built.
